## Part 1

To tuck your cat into bed properly you're going to need a few things. They are:
* A bed (preferably a high bed).
* A blanket.
    * You can substitute a blanket for one of your own coats or jumpers (cats love this!).
* Some Catnip (only to be used when first introducing your cat to the idea of being 'tucked-in'.
* A positive attitude!

## Part 2

Now that you're all set up, it's time to tuck your cat in!

Get your blanket/jumpe/coat set up on your bed. We're going to wrap it up so as to create a little nest (refer to the image at the top!).

Sprinkle some catnip into the nest you have built. This will attract your cat.

If all goes well, your cat should be in the blanket nest by now!

Once the cat is secured in the nest, you're going to want to pull the blanket over them so that they're fully covered.

> Another hot tip - Make sure to leave their lil heads poking out so they can breath and see their surroundings!

Now that your cat is all tucked-in you'll need to stay with them for a bit so they are calm and comfortable.

> Another hot tip - Tuck yourself in while you're at it. Cat's love being tucked in with their friends.

That concludes our lesson on how to tuck your cat into bed. You're welcome.
